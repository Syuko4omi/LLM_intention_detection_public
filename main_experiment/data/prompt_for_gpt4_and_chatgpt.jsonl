To be specific I worry about the homeless rate with children. For example, myself being from Albuquerque New Mexico, the number of homeless children and teenagers is heartbreaking. And what about you?\nER: I agree.\nER: I grew up in California, lived in Louisiana, and then moved to Massachusetts. There's different kinds of childhood poverty between those three states and I wish there was more I could do to help. If you're an adult and you're homeless it's a very different situation than being 6 years old and homeless.

Children should not have to do through so much tragedy and devastation at such young ages. It is great that others are looking out for them.\nER: Absolutely!\nER: In fact, you can even help!\nER: If you want to make a small donation from your task payment, I'm sure it would be greatly appreciated!\nER: You can donate just a few cents, or even the whole amount of your final payout if you choose!\nEE: I probably will do that.\nEE: If everyone did something, it helps the bigger overall picture and they are so worth it.\nER: Absolutely!\nER: I mean, we already spend money on small snacks or a coffee we could forgo, why not give it to a charitable cause?\nER: How noble of you!\nEE: I just know that if I were a child in need, I would be grateful for all the help I could get.\nER: Absolutely!\nER: I remember being in a group home as a kid, and a bunch of ladies had made blankets and hats for us. I still have the blanket I was made to this day!\nER: A little goes a long way :)\nEE: Wow, that is so good to hear.\nEE: I'm sure it is not easy for organizations to get charitable work done but I am grateful they try and that others get involved.\nEE: Kuddos to them!\nER: Yeah, it really is humbling to watch society ban together and help each other!\nER: Either way, I'm sure Save the Children will appreciate your donation, and be able to save many more children in the future.\nER: You have a good day!\nEE: The life of a child is always worth saving.\nEE: You have a good day as well.\n\nQ: Explain whether the last utterance clearly conveys the speaker's intention.
